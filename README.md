## Workpackage 6:
#### Objectives of Workpackage 6: 
- O6.1: Develop an infrastructure to manage and analyse genotypic and phenotypic data.
- O6.2: Support the active, integrated management of genetic resources (GenRes) by genebanks (GB).
- O6.3: Empower users of GenRes to identify material of interest with accuracy and precision.
- O6.4: Provide a modelling environment allowing researchers and breeders to test new accessions against reference data.

#### Tasks of Workpackage 6: 
- Task 6.1: Development of an open infrastructure for the management of genotypic and phenotypic data.
- Task 6.2: Development of a Portable set of Interoperable Tools for Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Genetic Resources
- Task 6.3: Enhancement of EURISCO with new tools for data discovery and visualization.
